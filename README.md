# BankAccountManagementSystem

### Project Topic
* A Simple Bank Account Management System

### Project Description 
* We will develop a project that allows you to develop a bank account management system using basic programming skills in C language. This project will allow users to create bank accounts, view their balances, and make deposits and withdrawals.

### User Registration Procedures 
* A registration system should be created that can receive information such as users' name, account number and initial balance. Users should be able to perform operations such as creating new accounts, updating their existing accounts or deleting their accounts.

### Account Operations 
* Users should be able to log in and access their accounts with their account numbers and passwords. Users should be able to view and update their current balances.
* Users should be able to make deposits and withdrawals to their accounts.

### File Operations
* Data such as user information and account information should be stored in a file and loaded from this file when the program is started.
* When any action is taken or the program is closed, the data should be updated and saved to the file.

### User Interface 
* A user-friendly interface should be created. Menus and operation options should be presented to the user. Appropriate checks and error checks should be made to get the necessary inputs from the user.
